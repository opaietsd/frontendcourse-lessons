    <h3>Urban Forests Create a Birdlife Boom in New Zealand Cities – Even Species Absent for Generations</h3>
    <img src="images/bird.jpg" alt="blue bird" width="500px"/>
        <p>Just ten minutes beyond the center of Wellington lies a wild paradise, where the birdsong of as many as 40 species ring out above hikers.</p>
        <p>The massive urban forest of Zealandia is helping prove that if you restore native forest in cities, native species will come back, and for a place with as unique an ecology as New Zealand, that’s all the more important.</p>
        <p>The park, described as an eco-sanctuary, is delightful on its own, but it's having a halo effect on bird communities in suburban, and even urban areas of the nation’s capital.</p>
        <p>Opened in 1999, native birds have since increased during annual counts by 50%, while for some species that aren't rare but shy away from cities, those figures are much higher. The numbers of kākā had increased by 250%, kererū by 186%, and tūī by 121% (the Māori  accents denote a long vowel, i.e. “too-ee.”)</p>
        <p>“In the 1990s seeing a tūī in suburban Wellington was a big deal, let alone a kākā,” Adam Ellis, a keen birdwatcher in Wellington, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/urban-forests-create-birdlife-boom-in-new-zealands-cities?utm_source=What+Could+Go+Right%3F&utm_campaign=fd1874212e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_05_25_09_11&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_614470cd6d-fd1874212e-478660250">told the Guardian, reporting on the news</a>. “Zealandia … created such a change in bird life that birds like tūī became a common garden bird.”</p>
    <h3>Till Death Do Us Bark: Watch Inseparable Shelter Dogs Get Married in Adorable Ceremony</h3>
        <img src="images/dogs.jpg" alt="happy dogs" width="500px"/>
        <p>Two inseparable shelter dogs got married in an adorable ceremony, with their own specially made mini chapel complete with bubble machine</p>
        <p>Nine-year-old Peanut and three-year-old Cashew got married at the San Antonio Humane Society (SAHS) in Bexar County in Texas last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Both Chihuahuas were surrendered in April 2022 by their families to SAHS as they could no longer be taken care of.</p>
        <p>The pair met in the SAHS medical building after their respective dental surgeries and instantly bonded.</p>    
        <p>After watching their relationship blossom, staff decided to organise the ceremony in the hopes of finding Peanut and Cashew their forever homes.</p>
        <p>The romantic occasion featured the pups dressed to the nines with a red carpet flanked with dog-shaped hedges.</p>
    <h3>Wintering Monarch Butterflies Bounce Back in Mexico – Numbers Surge by 35%</h3>
    <img src="images/butterflies.jpg" alt="orange butterflie" width="500px"/> 
    <p>Following a massive, 125-fold increase in western monarch butterfly populations in America, a 35% increase has just been recorded in the numbers of monarchs arriving in Mexico.</p>
    <p>As one of the great migratory species on the planet, entomologists in Mexico don't bother counting individuals, but rather the acreage of mountaintop pine trees on which they roost.</p>
    <p>In the pine-tree covered mountains west of Mexico City, this year seven acres were covered with butterflies compared to around 5.8 last year.</p>
    <p>Arrivals in California on their way down to Mexico<a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/far-more-monarch-butterflies-in-ca-this-year/">were also in much greater numbers</a>.</p>
    <p>Experts in Mexico, according to AP, are reporting that this is due to a mixture of an overall reduction in wintering forest loss and adaptation to what they describe as climate change, although they add plenty of non-climate related aspects under the umbrella such as pesticide use and logging.</p>
    <p>Normally, the monarchs arrive in late October to early November, escaping the cold in North America. They typically then leave around March, moving to either side of the Rocky Mountains as far north as Canada. Last year was different, in that most of them left in February on a fortuitous flight that saw them escape an April heat wave.</p>
    <h3>Lucky Rescue for 5 Sheep Stuck on English Rooftop</h3>
    <img src="images/sheep.jpeg" alt="five animals in trouble" width="500px"/>
    <p>It was a case of ‘all's wool that ends wool’ for five sheep who found themselves on the rooftop of a house in Yorkshire—and were successfully rescued by local firemen.</p>
    <p>While goats are famous for appearing on all fours in places that boggle the mind, these five farm sheep had apparently leapt from a nearby field onto the roof, where they then found themselves quite stuck.</p>
    <p>West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were called to Barnsley Road in Newmillerdam, England— where rescue officer Damian Cameron <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-61262407">worked with a local landowner</a> to create a makeshift bridge the sheep could use to escape from the roof.</p>
    <p>Cameron reckoned that one sheep noticed the bridge.</p>
    <p>This Rambo then dragged the other four there instinctually, as the flock animals prefer to stay as a team.</p>
    <p>Fortunately it all turned out well, as all five sheep alighted the bridge and back into the paddock.</p>
    <h3>Students Write Adorable Letters on Behalf of Shelter Animals to Boost Adoptions – And it Worked</h3>
    <img src="images/sunday.jpg" alt="cute dog Sunday" width="500px"/>
    <p>The persuasive words of an 8-year old written in crayon cracked open the hearts of potential dog adopters to empty the kennel crates of a local shelter.</p>
    <p>Their hand-written personalized notes resulted in skyrocketing adoption rates for the pooches least likely to get adopted in the Virginia capital.</p>
    <p>No human could resist a plea like, “If you do adopt me, I hope I will brighten up your Sundays like the sun. You’ll be my Sunday Special, and I hope I’ll be yours!”</p>
    <p>Kensey Jones, a second-grade teacher at St. Michael's Episcopal church in Richmond, is also a volunteer at<a href="https://www.rva.gov/animal-care-control">Richmond Animal Care and Control</a>. She needed to come up with an idea for a writing assignment, and had the idea to try and boost adoption rates by giving the dogs their own advocacy voice.</p>
    <p>“The idea just came to me to connect persuasive writing with these adoptable pets that need a forever home,” Jones <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/pets/kids-wrote-pleas-to-help-unwanted-shelter-pups-find-homes-it-worked/">told the Washington Post</a>, adding that it was “a way that I could make their writing real for [the students], and actually make an impact on the world and our Richmond community.”</p>
    <p>She pitched the idea to the shelter's manager Christie Peters, who thought it was wonderful. This particular shelter sees a high adoption rate of about 3 weeks. Animals with medical problems can take much longer, and face being euthanized if the problem is serious enough.
